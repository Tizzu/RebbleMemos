# Rebble Memos
This Application lets you push custom memos to a Rebble-enabled Pebble smartwatch

The application lets you define a title for your memo, a subtitle (visible from the timeline) and a body (visible within the pin itself). You can also define a time and date, and also select the Memo icon from a selection of 5 icons (for now).

### Usage
**Before using this application you have to retreive your Pebble timeline token** (you can install https://apps.rebble.io/en_US/application/5d9ac26dc393f54d6b5f5445 on your Pebble - or search for "Generate Token" on the Rebble Store - and follow the instructions to get it and put it inside "token.txt"

Once it's there you can open the application and start sending pins!

### Future releases (may) include:
* **Pin History** - Modify already sent pins (as long as they aren't deleted by the user)
